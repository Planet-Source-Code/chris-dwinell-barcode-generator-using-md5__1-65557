## Barcode Generator Using MD5

### Description

This is a small example of how to create an MD5 hash and turn it into a barcode which could be used also as a password verification system.

Example: you could take the generated barcode, save it to a file, then when a user types in their password, the program would verify it by comparing the saved barcode to the one generated by the user logging in.

I appologize ahead of time for not commenting the code. It was an idea that just popped into my head, so I threw together in a few minutes. On a side note, the MD5 class I included is not my work. It was one I found on the internet and had saved in my archive, so I don't know who or where I got it from.
